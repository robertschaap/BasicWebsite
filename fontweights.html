        <h3>Font Weight Basic</h3>
        <p>Besides the "normal" and "bold" properties, font-weight can take numerical values from 100 to 900 as well, 100 being the lightest and 900 the boldest weight. This does not apply equally to all fonts however.</p>
        <p>In the example's below, Avenir Next has weight properties for all numeric values. Note that this is a font that is mostly used on Macs so it's possible that if you're viewing this page from a Windows or Linux machine, the font will be replaced by Arial or Helvetica. Arial is a good example of a font with only a few of the numeric weights available, Helvetica has a few more than that.</p>
        <p>The default value for paragraphs is "normal" which correlates to a numeric weight of 400. The default for headings is "bold" which correlates to a weight of 700.</p>
