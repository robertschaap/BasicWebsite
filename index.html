        <h3>About Fonts Tested</h3>
        <p>This is a simple site about fonts. There are a few CSS properties that have a big impact on how your site is presented and behaves. Two of these are the font-size and font-weight properties.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="fontsizes.html">Font Sizes</a></h3>
        <p>There are three main ways to size things in CSS; using pixels, EM units and REM units. Depending on which you choose to use for your site, you will need to be aware of a few caveats. The font sizes page dives into these and shows a few examples.</p>
        
        <h3><a href="fontweights.html">Font Weights</a></h3>
        <p>No doubt you're aware of the bold, italic and underline styles that are found in text editors, e-mail programmes and basically any kind of program that allows you to format text. The bold property is an example of font weight in CSS, it allows you to style how "heavy" a font looks. The font weight page shows you how to use CSS' most common properties.</p>
